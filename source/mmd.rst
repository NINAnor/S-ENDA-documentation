Metno Metadata Format (MMD) is an XML metadata format for storing information about scientific datasets. It is meant for consumption by internal systems at MET and to be a corner stone in our data management policy.

The objectives of the MMD standard format:

* To facilitate documentation of data and products managed by METNO.
* To facilitate metadata re-use between different projects and services at METNO.
* To be compatible with the GCMD DIF and ISO19115/ISO19139 metadata standards as imposed by WMO and Norge Digitalt/INSPIRE.
* To provide as lossless conversion between the different formats as possible.

The MMD is ment to be used for metadata management in support of internal and external services including, but not restricted to:

* BarentsWatch
* Halo
* METSIS
  * Arctic Data Centre
  * WMO Global Cryosphere Watch

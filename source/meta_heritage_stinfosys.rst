**Stinfosys is build to adress the needs of:**

* Forecasters: Co-location of observations, visualization and quality management for stations.
* Climate statistics: Management of long (high quality) time series.
* Maintenance management: logistic needs

**Data from stinfosys is currently used in:**

* KRO: logistic management system for weather stations at MET
* Kvalobs: Quality control system for observations at MET
* KDVH/ODA: Data storage at MET
* Obsinn: System for handling incoming observations at MET
* Frost.met.no: API for observations, externally available
* Seklima.met.no: GUI for observations, externally available

**External connections to stinfosys:**
  
None is currently(Jan 2020) operationalized, but there is work being done on these fronts:

* M2M connection to the Public Roads Administration(SVV)'s metadatabase for measurement stations (MÃ¥lestasjonsregisteret)
* External metadata registration software/gui for the Norwegian Institute for Bioeconomy Research (NIBIO)
* M2M interaction with the OSCAR/Surface database (WMO metadatabase for surfae based weather stations)

Introduction to FAIR
====================

FAIR data principles have been introduced to the scientific community in 2016 in `The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship <https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18>`_ paper. Since then, they have become the reference point for many projects and efforts, both at the European and global level. The highest goal of these efforts is to move towards open science, i.e. to make scientific research available to the whole society. In this context, scientific research has a broad meaning, from data publications, to digital and physical data, to software or anything that has a value for the community. 
One of the basis of this concept is the ability and willingness to share knowledge as well as data. In turns, many components will benefit from this, from the general public, to the scientific community, to the research sponsors and funders, to the scientists themselves. 

FAIR data principles focus on Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability of digital assets. As stated in the original paper "The Principles may be adhered to in any combination and incrementally, as data providers’ publishing environments evolve to increasing degrees of ‘FAIRness’. Moreover, the modularity of the Principles, and their distinction between data and metadata, explicitly support a wide range of special circumstances.". This shows that a FAIRification process can be approach in several steps, thus valuing any improvements that are made to achieve FAIRness.

The FAIR principles tackle the key points to allow people to find, access and use data, with specific focus on human and machine-to-machine interaction. Findability principles help to create a good description of (meta)data, to allow resources to be discovered; Accessibility principles concerns the protocols to access the (meta)data which are discovered; Interoperabiliy principles focus on the content of the digital resources and their representation, to allow data integration and proper understanding of the accessed resources; and finally Reusabity principles stress the importance of proper information to allow correct reuse and citation. 

Detailed descriptions and explanations of the FAIR principles can be found in many online resources and will therefore not be reported here, but a list of relevant links is provided instead:

The S-ENDA project is guided by these principles, with the scope of improve the current status of data at MET Norway, creating a better support of sharing of data and knowledge created within the institute and integration with external resources.

The FAIR Principles
====================

S-ENDA's vision is that everyone, from professional users to the general public, shall have easy, secure and stable access to dynamic geodata.

The FAIR principles constitute the governing principles of S-ENDA. This means that all contributions to the project shall be aligned with the FAIR principles.

The FAIR data principles were introduced in 2016 through `The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship <https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18>`_ paper. Since then, they have become the reference point for many projects and efforts, both at the European and global level. The highest goal of these efforts is to move towards open science. I.e., to make scientific research available to the whole society. In this context, scientific research has a broad meaning, from data publications, to digital and physical data, to software or anything that has a value for the community. A basis of this concept is the ability and willingness to share knowledge, including data. This is, in turn, beneficial to, e.g., the general public, the scientific community, the research sponsors and funders, and to everyone working with research and development.

The FAIR data principles are:

- Digital assets should be Findable
- Digital assets should be Accessible
- Digital assets should be Interoperable
- Digital assets should be Reusable

As stated in the original paper "The Principles may be adhered to in any combination and incrementally, as data providers’ publishing environments evolve to increasing degrees of ‘FAIRness’. Moreover, the modularity of the Principles, and their distinction between data and metadata, explicitly support a wide range of special circumstances." This shows that a FAIRification process can be approached in several steps, thus valuing any improvements that are made to achieve FAIRness.

The FAIR principles tackle the key points to allow people to find, access and use data, with specific focus on human and machine-to-machine interaction.

- The *Findability* principle requires good descriptions of (meta)data, to allow resources to be discovered. 
- The *Accessibility* principle concerns the protocols to access the (meta)data which are discovered. 
- The *Interoperabiliy* principle focus on the content of the digital resources and their representation, to allow data integration and proper understanding of the accessed resources.
- The *Reusability* principle stress the importance of proper information to allow correct reuse and citation, including reuirements for licensing.

Detailed descriptions and explanations of the FAIR principles can be found in many online resources and will therefore not be reported here, but a list of relevant links is provided instead:

As stated above, the S-ENDA project uses these principles as guidance for the performed work, with the goal of unifying the data management at MET Norway and other Norwegian environmental institutes and agencies, to improve the sharing and reuse of created data and knowledge.

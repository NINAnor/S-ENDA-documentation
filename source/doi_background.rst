What is a DOI?
==============

A DOI is a unique, persistent and web resolvable identifier (PID), that uniquely and persistently resolves to a digital resource. 
DOIs are a key element to make digital resources findable on the web, thus allowing for their easy discovery. Additionally 
they can be used when citing a specific resource on the web. 

DOIs practically consist of an alphanumeric string made up by a prefix and a suffix. The combination of a unique DOI prefix (assigned 
to a particular DOI registrant, i.e. METNO) and a unique DOI suffix (provided by that registrant for a specific object, or automatically 
assigned at registration time) is unique. Suffix and prefix are separated by a forward slash (e.g. 10.21343/z9n1-qw63). 

DOIs in a FAIR perspective
==========================

The use of DOIs for datasets relates more specifically with Findability and Reusability principles: 

Findability
-----------
Making a resource findable is the first step to allow for sharing of data, and for this reason this is a key point for achieving FAIRness of data. 
The first FAIR guideline principle states the following: 

- F1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier.

Thus, assigning a DOI to a digital resource adheres with the first principle of FAIRness, as the identifier will be globally unique as well as persistent.

Additionally, the third principle for findability: 

- F3: Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe.

points out that metadata and the dataset should be connected explicitly by mentioning a datasetâ€™s globally unique and persistent identifier in the metadata of that 
specific dataset. This applies more particularly for data formats that do not include metadata in their headers, usually resulting in separate files for data and
metadata. 

Reusability
-----------
Reusability of data is strictly related with the possibility of citing data. When the DOI is incorporated into a citation it becomes a guaranteed location for the 
data, because the DOI will always resolve to the right web address (URL). Using a DOI allows then for proper citation of data when it is reused, giving the right 
credits and visibility to scientists.

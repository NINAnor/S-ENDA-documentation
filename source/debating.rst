Debating
========

Discussions about the S-ENDA documentation are kept in the `issue-tracker at github
<https://github.com/metno/S-ENDA-documentation/issues>`_ or in the public `gitter chat
<https://gitter.im/metno/S-ENDA-documentation>`_. We aim to keep the actual documentation as short
and concise as possible. As such, we will link to background information instead of writing it out
in the actual documents.

We seek

* To obtain consensus and win-win solutions
* To understand and communicate
* Synergy (recognising that different backgrounds and opinions can lead to better solutions)

Apart from this, please adhere to general codes of conduct in the open-source community (e.g., the `Django Code of
Conduct <https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/>`_) when debating. If you believe someone is
violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing ap-ledere-s-enda@met.no.

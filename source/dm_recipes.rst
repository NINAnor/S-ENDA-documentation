Register, Index, and Expose Metadata
------------------------------------

In order to make a dataset findable, the following steps must be performed:

#. Create MMD XML record of metadata
#. Translate from MMD to ISO19115
#. Indexing in CSW
#. Expose ISO19115 metadata via CSW to the internet

This is done with the s-enda-find Virtual Machine (VM), for which a Vagrant configuration is available in https://github.com/metno/S-ENDA-Prototype.

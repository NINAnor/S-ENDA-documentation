# use-cases-for-S-ENDA
Use case descriptions for the S-ENDA project

# Conventions

* master branch: only for complete use case descriptions. Corrections/changes are handled in hotfix
  branches, and must be reviewed before merging
* develop branch: for ideas - here it is enough to have, e.g., one line describing the use case goal

The master branch will be linked from readthedocs (and/or similar), and shall be complete, nice and
understandable - i.e., so it does not give the impression that it is half-done work...
